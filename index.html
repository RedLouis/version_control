    <h1>Version Control Basics</h1>

    <p>Version control is essential for managing code changes in software development projects. Here's an example of using Git, a popular version control system:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add files to the staging area
git add file1.js file2.css

# Commit changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create a new branch
git branch new-feature

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout new-feature

# Make changes to your code
# ...

# Add and commit changes on the new branch
git add . 
git commit -m "Added new feature"

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the new feature branch into main
git merge new-feature

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This is just a basic example of how version control works. Git provides powerful features for collaboration and tracking changes over time.</p>
